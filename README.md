1. Poliphili hypnerotomachia, Wherein he sheweth, that all humaine and worldlie things are but a dreame, and but as vanitie it selfe. In the setting foorth whereof many things are figured worthie of remembrance.

    _ The Author beginneth his Hypnerotomachia, to set downe the hower and time when in his sleepe it seemed to him that hee was in a quiet solitarie desart, and vninhabited plaine, and from thence afterward how he entered vnaduisedly before he was aware, with great feare, into a darke obscure and vnfrequented wood.

      * The discription of the morning.

    _  Poliphilus being thus distempered in this daungerous and obscure wood, at length getteth foorth, and being come to a faire Riuer, indeuoring to rest himselfe and coole his heate, he heard a most delightful harmonie, which made him forget to drinke, and followe after the voice, which brought him to a woorse perplexitie.

    _ Poliphilus sheweth, that he thought he did sleep againe, and in his dreame that he was in a Vallie, inuironed with mountaines and hilles, the end whereof was shut vp in a maruellous sort, with a mightie pyramides worthie of admiration: vpon the top whereof was a high obeliske, which with great pleasure hee beheld, and diligently discribeth.

    _ Poliphil•s, after the discription of the huge Pyramides and Obeliske, discourseth of maruelous woorkes in this Chapter, namely of a horsse of Colos. of an O•phan•, but especially of a most rare and straunge Porche.

    _ After that Poliphylus had at large made a demonstration of the dew proportion of the Gate, hee proceedeth to describe the ornaments thereof, and their excellencie.

    _ Poliphilus entring a little waye in at the described porch, with great delight he there also beheld how it was garnished and adorned, and after as he was comming out he met with a monstruous dragon whereat he was extreemlie afraide, and compelled to runne backe into the building, and at last getting foorth with much adoe hee came into a fertile place.

    _ Poliphilus sheweth the commodiousnesse of the countrie where-into hee was come, in his trauailing within the same, he came vnto a goodlie Fountaine, and howe hee sawe fiue faire Damsels comming towardes him, and their woondering at his comming thither, assuring him from hurte, and inuiting him to bee a partaker of their solaces.

    _ Poliphilus setling himselfe vnder the assurance of the fiue Nymphes, went with them to the bathes where they had great laughter in the deuise of the fountaine, and also by his vnction. Afterward being brought to the Queene Eutherillida, •e did see many thinges worthie of regard, but chiefly the worke of a fountaine.

    _ Poliphilus sheweth as well as hee may, how exceeding great the Maiestie of the Queene was, the manner of her Residence and seruice. His fauourable entertainment. Howe shee marueiled at him.

    _ Poliphilus followeth to shew besides this great banket of a most excelcellent daunce or gaine, and how the Queene did commit him to two of her Nymphes, the which did leade and condust him to the sight of many wonderfull things, and as they talked, shewed vnto him the secrecies of such things as hee stood in doubt of. Finally, how they came to the three gates, in the middlemost whereof, hee remained amongest the amorous Nymphes.

    _ In this place Poliphilus being left alone, a most fayre Nymphe (when hee was forsaken of the lasciuious company) came vnto him, whose beautie and apparell Poliphilus dooth amourously describe.

    _ The most fayre Nymph beeing come to Poliphilus, bearing a Torch in her left hand, with the other tooke him and inuited him to walke with her, and there Poliphilus by her loue was more inflamed.

    _ Polia, as yet vnknowne to her Louer Poliphilus, shee gratiously assureth him: who for her extreame beautie, hee indeuoreth his minde to loue. And both of them going to the triumphes, they see innumerable youths a•d Damosels, sporting with great delight.

    _ Poliphilus in this prescribed place, did beholde foure tryumphing Chariots, all set with precious stones and uwelles, by a great number of youthes, in the honour of Iupiter.
THE first of the foure marueilous tryumphant Chariots, had foure rounde wheeles, of Perfect greene E
      * The second Tryumph.

      * The third Tryumph.

      * The fourth Tryumph.

    _ The Nymph doth shew to Poliph•lus the multitude of yoong Louers; and their Loues, what they were, and •n what sort beloued.

    _ The Nymph hauing at large declared vnto Poliphilus the mysticall triumphs and extreeme loue, afterwards she desired him to go on further, where also with great delight he beheld innumerable other Nymphs, with their desired louers▪ a thousand sorts of pleasures solacing themselues vpon the gr••ne grasse, fresh shadowes, and by the coole riuers and cleere fountaines. And how Poliphilus there had with madnes almost forgotten himselfe in the passions of desire, but hope did asswag• his furie, quieting himselfe in the beholding of the sweete sauour of the faire Nymph.

    _ The Nymph leadeth the inamored Poliphilus to other pleasant places, where he beheld innumerable Nymphs solaci••••hem, and also the triumph of Vertum••s and P•m•na.
